  Braj Bhasha is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Braj region around Mathura and Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh. It is the language of Krishna bhakti poetry and was used by saint-poets like Surdas, Bihari, and Keshavdas. Braj is closely related to Hindi but has distinct grammatical features and a rich poetic vocabulary.

  - Postpositions: "में" → "माहीं/मैं", "को" → "कूं/कौं", "से" → "तें/सों"
  - Infinitive verbs often end in "-न" or "-नो"
