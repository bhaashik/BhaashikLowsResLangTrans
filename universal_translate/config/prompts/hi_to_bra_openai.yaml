  Braj Bhasha is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Braj region around Mathura and Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh. It is the language of Krishna bhakti poetry and was used by saint-poets like Surdas, Bihari, and Keshavdas. Braj is closely related to Hindi but has distinct grammatical features and a rich poetic vocabulary.

  - Pronouns: "मैं" → "मैं/हौं", "तू" → "तू/तैं", "यह" → "यह/यो", "वह" → "वह/सो"
  - Verb conjugations use distinct endings (e.g., "-यो/-ई/-त" for past tense)
  - Present tense: "है" → "है/हौं", "हैं" → "हैं/सैं"
  - Postpositions: "में" → "माहीं/मैं", "को" → "कूं/कौं", "से" → "तें/सों"
  - Infinitive verbs often end in "-न" or "-नो"
  - Oblique forms differ: "राम" → "राम/रामहि/रामकौं"
  - Rich use of diminutives and honorifics
